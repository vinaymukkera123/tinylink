```jsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const ProjectRoutes = () => {
  let element = useRoutes([
    { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <AboutPage /> },
    // Add more routes as needed
  ]);

  return element;
};
```
